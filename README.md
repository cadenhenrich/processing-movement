# Processing Movement
> § A Basic Processing™ Movement Project

## Why
This project is a basic movement system for Processing
that can be used as a stepping off point for other,
more advanced movement systems.

## Usage
Included are two files, one for the main sketch,
and one for the player class.
This project uses the `W`, `A`, and `D` keys for movement,
where `W` is jump, and `A` and `D` move left and right.
Additionally, `SPACE` also pauses the game.

## License
This really doesn't need a license,
but I included GNU GPLv3 just for the fun of it.
